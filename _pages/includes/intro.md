# About Me

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at the INtelligent Data Engineering Lab, University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Paul Groth](https://pgroth.com) and [Dr. Klim Zaporojets](https://klimzaporojets.github.io/). My research focuses on temporal knowledge graphs and knowledge acquisition, with particular interest in combating temporal degradation in entity linking by integrating dynamic contrastive learning, multimodal fusion, and fairness-aware modeling for low-degree entities.

Before joining UvA, I received my Master's degree in Control Engineering from Beijing University of Technology in 2022, where I was advised by [Prof. Dr. Yong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UAaN_RAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My masterâ€™s research focused on graph neural networks under power-law distribution and multi-view graph representation learning.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Shenyang Institute of Technology in 2014. During this period, I laid a solid foundation in systems control, electronics, and applied mathematics, which later inspired my interest in machine learning and structured data modeling.

If you are interested in **academic collaboration** in the areas of temporal knowledge graphs, entity-centric learning, or multimodal information integration, feel free to reach out to me via email at [p.zhang@uva.nl](mailto:p.zhang@uva.nl).
